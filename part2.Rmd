## Overview

Now in the second portion of the project, I will analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. I will:

1. Provide a basic summary of the data
2. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.

## Loading the data

The data is part of the R datasets. We will load it and convert the dose to a factor for ease of grouping the data by dose.

```{r loaddata}
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
```
